<h2>What international data transfers occur at Social Media Marketing Tool?</h2>
<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other data protection laws, information about you may only be transferred from your region to other regions if certain requirements are met. For instance, under the GDPR, information about you may be transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) to outside the EEA if adequate data protections are in place. Our Services are managed by Social Media Marketing Tool&rsquo;s headquarters in Canada. As the European Commission considers Canada to be a country which provides adequate data protection, information about you may be transferred from the EEA to Canada.<br><br>Social Media Marketing Tool also uses third-party service providers, such as managed hosting providers, credit card processors, and technology partners to provide the software, networking, infrastructure and other services required to operate the Services. These third-party providers may process or store personal data on servers outside of the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, including in Canada or the US. We rely on adequacy (if sent to Canada) and standard contractual clauses (if sent to the US or onward to other countries) to ensure that information about you is lawfully transferred under EU law. In this case, we have implemented supplementary measures as outlined in the section &ldquo;How do we safeguard your information?&rdquo;.<br><br>The third-party service providers we use to help us deliver the Services and which process your Content are referred to as &ldquo;subprocessors&rdquo; and are listed on this page.<br><br>By its nature, social media data can be shared with people around the globe. The Social Networks and Third-Party Services that you choose to integrate with our Services may collect, store, and process your information from various locations around the world according to their own terms and privacy policies.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How do we safeguard your information?</h2>
<p>Social Media Marketing Tool maintains industry standard security safeguards to protect your information. This includes ensuring our employees receive appropriate security and privacy training and guidance so they are aware of the measures they need to implement to protect your information.<br><br>Access controls are in place to limit access to your information to those who need it to perform their jobs. For example, information about you may be provided to our customer support specialists to help you with your requests. Individuals who are permitted to handle your information must adhere to confidentiality obligations.<br><br>We encrypt data in transit and at rest, where appropriate, to ensure that your information is kept private. We undertake service provider security and privacy reviews to ensure that service providers follow our stringent requirements to safeguard your information, and we also enter into data protection agreements with our service providers. All payment information is fully encrypted and handled only by PCI certified organizations. More detailed information on our security practices is available in our Trust Center and Social Media Marketing Tool Security Practices web pages.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How long do we retain your information?</h2>
<p>In general Social Media Marketing Tool does not permanently store Content from Social Networks. Rather, when you login to the Services, we retrieve data from Social Networks in real time so that it is displayed in the platform for viewing during your session. We store other Content that you produce (such as draft Content for publication on Social Networks) so that you can easily access this material on the Services. Messages in Inbox are stored for 6 weeks to enable you to take any action required, such as replying to messages. Social Media Marketing Tool Analytic products such as Analytics and Insights will store mentions related to our customers from social media audiences for up to 25 months to allow our customers to conduct trending and analysis (see for example, the Social Media Marketing Tool Metrics library).<br><br>Aggregated data is used by Social Media Marketing Tool for analysis, product improvement, and troubleshooting purposes. In some cases, Content may continue to exist on the Social Networks even after you or we delete it from our Services, and you will need to contact the relevant Social Network directly if you want it to remove this Content.<br><br>We retain your information as long as required to provide the Services requested by you, for record keeping purposes, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce the terms for the Services. After it is no longer necessary for us to retain information about you, or otherwise upon your request, we will dispose of it in a secure manner or anonymize the information.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
