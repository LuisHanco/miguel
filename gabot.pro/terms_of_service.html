<h2>Access and User Accounts</h2>
<p>You can access the Service via a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE or Edge) at this domain. The Service is SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) enabled and enforced. To access the Service, you must register for an account (&ldquo;Account&rdquo;) and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the account registration form.

If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify by email.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>General Payment Terms</h2>
<p>Premium features of the Service will require you to pay fees upon registering for the applicable premium service. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Fees vary based on the plan, with different pricing schemes for individual users and organizations.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Price</h2>
<p>Social Media Marketing Tool reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Social Media Marketing Tool will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information, located here.<br><br>Social Media Marketing Tool may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Social Media Marketing Tool gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Social Media Marketing Tool, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Social Media Marketing Tool&rsquo;s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Payment Authorization</h2>
<p>You authorize Social Media Marketing Tool to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Social Media Marketing Tool, to the payment method specified in your account.

<h2>Subscription Service and Cancellation Policy</h2>
<p>The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (&ldquo;Subscription Service&rdquo;).

Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.

We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by accessing your Account Settings or by contacting us by email.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Delinquent Accounts</h2>
<p>Social Media Marketing Tool may suspend or terminate access to the Service for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid.

<h2>User Content Generally</h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for any User Content you post to the Service and the consequences of posting or publishing it. You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that you post to the Service. Nevertheless, we need certain permission from you in order to provide the Service. By &ldquo;User Content&rdquo;, we mean any and all information and content a user submits to or uses with the Service. &ldquo;Content&rdquo; means information, data, text, software, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or any other materials. When we say &ldquo;post&rdquo;, we include posting, uploading, sharing, submitting or otherwise providing User Content in any manner in connection with the Service.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Restrictions on User Content</h2>
<p>Social Media Marketing Tool disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content.

<h2>Intellectual Property Rights in User Content</h2>
<p>You retain copyright and any other intellectual property rights you already hold in any User Content that you post. You represent and warrant that any User Content posted by you is original to or owned by you, or, you have obtained all necessary permissions and releases for the use of such content, and all content posted by you on the Service does not infringe any copyright or other proprietary or intellectual property right of any other person or entity.<br><br>By posting your User Content, you do not lose any ownership rights you may have to it. However, you do grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, and publicly display and perform your User Content in connection with the Service and our business, in any media formats or in tangible form and through any media channels now known or hereinafter developed.<br><br>By providing User Content to or via the Service to other users of the Service, you grant those users a non-exclusive license to access and use that User Content as permitted by these Terms and the functionality of the Service.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>User Content Disclaimer</h2>
<p>We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users post or publish and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. Social Media Marketing Tool may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using the Service you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Social Media Marketing Tool with respect to User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, Social Media Marketing Tool does not permit copyright-infringing activities on the Service.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Monitoring Content</h2>
<p>Social Media Marketing Tool does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (a) User Content; (ii) any content made available by third parties; or (iii) the use of the Service by its users. You acknowledge and agree that Social Media Marketing Tool reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Service for operational and other purposes. If at any time Social Media Marketing Tool chooses to monitor the content, Social Media Marketing Tool still assumes no responsibility or liability for the content or any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of content. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Service Availability and Commitment</h2>
<p>Although we strive to provide the most reliable software tools possible, interruptions and delays in accessing the Service are unavoidable. Because computer networks occasionally experience disruptions, we cannot guarantee that the Service will be available to you 100% of the time. We monitor our systems continually, and an engineer is typically available within an hour of service interruptions to take reasonable steps to resolve any reported issue, and we use reasonable efforts to restore service to our users promptly, often within a 24-hour period.<br><br>Regular backups of the database are made and retained at regular intervals. If you experience loss of data, we will attempt to restore data from the most recent working backup; however, we cannot guarantee that any lost user or data can be recovered or restored.<br><br>Under no circumstances will Social Media Marketing Tool or its suppliers be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Proprietary Rights</h2>
<p>The Service contains proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws and Social Media Marketing Tool and its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all copyright, trade secret, patent and other rights) in and to the Service and Content which is included in the Service (other than User Content). If you give feedback regarding the Service, for example recommendations for improvements or features, we have the right to use the feedback in any way and implementation of that feedback is owned by us and may become part of the Service without compensation to you.
